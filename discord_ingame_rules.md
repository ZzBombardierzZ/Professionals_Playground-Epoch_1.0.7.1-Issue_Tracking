## **üèóÔ∏è Base Building and Raiding Guidelines**
- **Hint - Use the Build Check Tool Before you Build Your Base:** To know if your desired base location is allowed, use the Player Menu > Build Check Tool.
- **Base Design Requirements:**
  - **No Floating Bases:** Must be accessible from the ground/water.
    - **Water Bases:** Must touch water and have accessible entry from the water.
  - **No Glitching:** It is not allowed to glitch in/out of your own base nor a base you're raiding.
  - **Raiding Accessibility:** Someone raiding using a ground entrance should be able to access all Raidable Objects.
    - **Definition of *Raidable Objects*:** Plot pole (VG), safes, lockboxes, storage objects, and vehicles.
    - *Hint - Plot poles are unable to be removed or destroyed. However, enemies are able to access the Virtual Garage*.
    - **Examples of Disallowed Raidable Base Design:**
      - Not allowed to make any Raidable Object inaccessible or make invisible by hiding inside walls or objects. This includes hiding plot poles inside a wall, safe, or object were only a small portion is visible.
      - Not allowed to use locked drawbridges or "elevator" garage doors to make the Raidable Objects inaccessible.
    - **Examples of Allowed Raidable Base Design:**
      - Allowed to have several doors from the ground entrance to the Raidable Objects. A limit of 20 doors is scripted.
      - Allowed to have decoy doors.
      - Allowed to have one way entrances, so long as there is a way out out of the base.
      - Allowed to have maze-like bases, so long as it is possible to get to the Raidable Objects.
      - Allowed to have have a drawbridge or "elevator" garage door to get to a part of the base that is not the plot pole or storages, such as roof access.
    - ***Bottom line:*** __If you can't raid it, it's not allowed.__
  - **Realistic Design:** Bases should look believable and feasible in real life.
    - *Example of Disallowed Base:* A 300-tonne base built atop a lamppost.
  - **Support Structures for Tower/Diagonal Bases:**
    - Must include support structures capable of holding platforms up to 10m or about 2 single metal floors in any direction.

  - Not allowed: `BRDM-2`, `BTR-60`, `T34`, `T55`, `Dingo`, or any vehicle where the gunner isn't exposed.
- **Plot Poles:**
  - Maximum of **3 plot poles per group**.
    - A group is defined as players who either share doors/safes with each other, or who play a majority of their playtime together.
- **Turrets:**
